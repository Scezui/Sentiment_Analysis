2023/04/23 10:39:23 PM GMT+8,Agree,"Of course, there is nothing wrong with the exercises as it is annually being performed"
2023/04/23 10:39:45 PM GMT+8,Disagree,"Of course not, as USA is using the Philippines to show their power to China"
2023/04/23 10:40:32 PM GMT+8,Disagree,"Negative, as I believe that China has greater power than USA, and sticking with China is a far better choice"
2023/04/23 10:41:31 PM GMT+8,Disagree,"Strongly disagree, as this only provokes the China in attacking our country"
2023/04/23 10:42:05 PM GMT+8,Agree,It is not bad to have this kind of exercise to show that we are not powerless to those bullies
2023/04/23 10:42:34 PM GMT+8,Agree,"Strongly agree, it will make the country look stronger, even for a moment only"
2023/04/23 10:43:02 PM GMT+8,Disagree,"No, we don't want China to see us as a Threat to their domination"

2023/04/23 10:44:32 PM GMT+8,Disagree,"No, because I do not want to be a slave again for another strong country "
2023/04/23 11:05:24 PM GMT+8,Disagree,"This Balikatan exercise was done annually, so it's not new. And it has a significant benefits in making a great relationship with the USA but I think it's an inappropriate decision to hold such activity amidst tension. I disagree because I think it will just escalate or intensify the tension between the region, even though the intention of such activity doesn't have the correlation with the tension that is happening, it can still be misinterpreted by other regions. Thus, there must be an intensive evaluation of the situation before deriving on a whim decision."
2023/04/24 3:24:45 PM GMT+8,Disagree,Disagree because the decision by the government and the United States to hold the largest Balikatan exercise suggests that the Philippines is selecting sides and aligning itself more closely with the United States.
2023/04/24 3:25:50 PM GMT+8,Agree,"The static display of military equipment is often a popular aspect of these exercises, as it allows the public to see firsthand the advanced technology and firepower that the U.S. military can bring to bear in the event of a conflict. However, it's important to note that military exercises like Balikatan are primarily focused on training and readiness, rather than actual combat operations."
2023/04/24 3:26:52 PM GMT+8,Agree,I agree to the decision of the government and USA because I believe it's for the betterment of everyone. 
2023/04/24 3:27:25 PM GMT+8,Agree,Good job PBBM. This is very useful for the additional defense when there's imminent danger and threat for our national security. Utilizing EDCA that will sooner to end it's contract   next year will be a smart move for the administration that the Philippines didn't ignore the importance of MDT between the US.
2023/04/24 3:32:14 PM GMT+8,Agree,"I agree, because it promotes partnership and camaraderie of 2 nations. It also strengthens the military of the Philippines."
2023/04/24 3:34:58 PM GMT+8,Agree,That's good news for Philippines... we can defend now our territorial water.
2023/04/24 3:35:14 PM GMT+8,Agree,"Based on the question above, this help to training and strengthen the Philippine enforcement when it comes in the battle. It gives experience which they can use when if something happens in the future."
2023/04/24 3:35:34 PM GMT+8,Agree,The United States of America are our friends and Allies for almost a century within more than 80 to 90 decades in Treaty Partnerships. Thank you and may God bless you and the Philippines' partnership into a more eventual success together with the Allied Countries of the World. God bless you and more power to you! 
2023/04/24 3:36:08 PM GMT+8,Agree,"The Philippines is being allied of the USA, of course they should give their full support and strong power, to defense our country,... thanks to you America...go go"

2023/04/24 5:54:29 PM GMT+8,Disagree,"I do believe that it is important to have the balikatan, however, I am not happy about the timing. Considering that there is a tension in Taiwan, it only seems to show that USA is showing off its power making us looked like being usef"
2023/04/24 5:55:25 PM GMT+8,Disagree,Absolutely not. What happens if the China decided to war us? Can USA assist us when they can't even deal with their own country 's problem
2023/04/24 5:56:36 PM GMT+8,Disagree,No way. I still believe that we are best being neutral in this political war between USA and China as we are only a small country and do not have a capability to defend ourselves 
2023/04/24 5:57:21 PM GMT+8,Agree,"Hell yeah. We are friends with Taiwan and of course if the China decides to war them,  we can assist them with the help of US troops"
2023/04/24 5:58:21 PM GMT+8,Agree,"Of course, there is nothing wrong with this movement as we are only performing our annual activity. It just depends on China on how they will take this activity "
2023/04/24 5:59:27 PM GMT+8,Disagree,I do not want to be affiliated in any way with the US as I have observed from the past where all their allies was abandoned by US
2023/04/24 6:00:14 PM GMT+8,Agree,I want to say that this is very helpful for the country to equip our military with the western knowledge in terms of warfare 
2023/04/24 6:01:21 PM GMT+8,Agree,"Of course. We can only gain from this activity as we will have our men trained and gain additional equipments. Additionally, we will have our minds at ease because there is a strong power that is protecting us"
2023/04/24 6:02:45 PM GMT+8,Disagree,"I just don't think that this is the time to increase the scale of Balikatan exercise as we consider the tension in the region. If China snaps, then we are on  a lot of trouble"
2023/04/24 6:03:51 PM GMT+8,Agree,"For me, I liked the idea of increasing the Balikatan exercise to show China that we are not someone that can be bullied"
2023/04/24 6:05:13 PM GMT+8,Disagree,Why did they decided to increase the scale of balikatan exercise when the tensions are rising in the region? Its just like they are using us to scare off China
2023/04/24 6:06:05 PM GMT+8,Agree,"I agree that this activity must be done, as we would like to regain the trust of USA to our country, considering that the last president really messed it up"
2023/04/24 6:07:10 PM GMT+8,Agree,"I agree as there is nothing wrong. The president told us that the military forces were for defensive only and not for offensive. As long as there are no reckless movements from china, i do not see any wrong "
2023/04/24 6:08:24 PM GMT+8,Agree,"Of course, it will be good for our country to be connected with some powerful countries considering that we are being bullied by China"
2023/04/24 6:09:31 PM GMT+8,Agree,Yes. Because I'm tired of always being bullied by China. It is time to show them that we are not something to scoff at
2023/04/24 6:12:22 PM GMT+8,Disagree,"No, because i believe that it is time for us to step up as we have our own sovereign and we must be responsible to protect it without any assistance from other countriess"
2023/04/24 6:14:10 PM GMT+8,Agree,Yeah of course. It is vital for our military to be updated with the current technology of the west to improve our military. It can also boost the morale of our military seeing the people who they will accompany when the war comes
2023/04/24 6:15:18 PM GMT+8,Agree,"Of course because what if China decides to do what they do to Taiwan. At least with the presence of US troops, they will have second thoughts"
2023/04/24 6:18:21 PM GMT+8,Disagree,I do not want any military troops in our own country. I strongly oppose this action of the government
2023/04/24 6:19:08 PM GMT+8,Disagree,I do not agree with this axtion because I believe that we are only being used by US to keep watch of Chinese movements in Taiwan 
2023/04/24 6:19:52 PM GMT+8,Agree,"Yes, because in case the war sparks, the US will be able to deploy their troops more easily and help us defend the country "
2023/04/24 6:22:05 PM GMT+8,Disagree,"NO! I STRONGLY OPPOSE BECAUSE THIS WILL ONLY TRIGGER CHINA TO ATTACK US. WE WILL BE AT THE CENTER OF EAR OF THE TWO COUNTRIES AND CONSIDERING THE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS, IT IS ONLY MATTER OF TIME BEFORE PHILIPPINES BECOMES WIPED OUT IN THE MAP"
2023/04/24 6:23:05 PM GMT+8,Agree,"Yes, because it eases my mind that we have the back of a strong country, and someone will help us when the war sparks."
2023/04/24 6:24:01 PM GMT+8,Disagree,"No, I just want the Philippines to be peaceful and strengthening the balikatan only provokes the China. I just hope that China is open-minded"
